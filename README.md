# Maze Generation: Hunt & Kill Algorithm

### Installation
**Unity Version:** 2021.3.8f1
<br><br>

### How to use:
When you start the maze you will first come face to face with a 10 by 10 version of the Hunt & Kill algorithm maze. Through the user interface you can scale and regenerate the maze as you see fit. From here you can also choose different textures for the maze. Every time you click the "regenerate" button, a new maze will appear. 
If you wanna see the maze closer up you can use the A/S/W/D keys. And if you want to change the angle of the maze, you can use your left mouse button. 

As a bonus I made sure that the user can switch scenes. If the user likes the maze they generated they can now play around in the maze itself. Switching scenes happens by pressing the O or P-keys on your keyboard. Once you switch scenes you can navigate through the maze using your mouse to look around and the W/A/S/D-keys to walk around. 

*Have Fun!* <br><br>
